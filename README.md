### Hi there, I am Arpit ðŸ‘‹
and I am a full-stack :robot: Roboticist  and AI researcher with a strong passion for Physics-based rendering. Broadly, I am interested in :mechanical_arm: robotic manipulation and Machine Learning.

* I work at Dexterity as a Robotics Engineer focusing on GPU-first Reinforcement Learning and accelerated inference.
* In my Ph.D. at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), I worked at the intersection of Tactile sensing, robotic simulation and physics-based rendering.
* Prior to joining Ph.D. program, I was a Research & Development Enginner at Nvidia working on Simulation Technology team. I worked on Sim2Real transfer techniques for robotic manipulation and quadruped robot.
